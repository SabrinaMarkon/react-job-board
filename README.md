How to run Redis on Windows:

1) Download Memurai (free) - "Redis-compatible cache and datastore for Windows" at memurai.com
2) Install with the .msi.
3) Find the installation folder (mine was C:\\Program Files\Memurai\
4) Open the Windows command prompt and cd into that folder and run memurai-cli
5) If everything worked out, you should see the Redis prompt as he shows us in the video.
6) Add to your Windows PATH if you want to run it without having to cd to the folder.
